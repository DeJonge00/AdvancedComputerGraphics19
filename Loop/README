This homework submission contains a QT project with the executable program. 
This program has been extended in subdivideLoop function with the fillBoundaryHalfedges 
function to fill the unset pointers. The edgePoint function now interpolates with a 
(1/2)(1, 1) mask for boundary points, while the vertexPoint function has been extended 
to interpolate new boundary vertices with a (1/8)(1,6,1) mask.

The fragment shader has been extended to be able to switch between wireframes, surface
reflection, reflectionlines and a gaussian color mode, which are toggleable from the ui.
